Erlang UUID
===========

An Erlang implementation of the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN
Namespace as defined in RFC 4122. This module implements the UUID versions 1,
3, 4 and 5. It also implements a custom time based UUID that is based on
version 1 but has a different layout to allow easy sorting on the creation
date.
