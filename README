Erlang UUID
===========

An Erlang implementation of the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN
Namespace as defined in RFC 4122. This module implements the UUID 
versions 1, 3, 4 and 5. It also implements a custom time based UUID
which is based on version 1 but has a different layout to allow 
easy sorting on the date of creation.
